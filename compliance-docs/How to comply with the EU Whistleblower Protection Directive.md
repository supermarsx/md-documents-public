How to Comply with 
the EU Whistleblower 
Protection Directive
Use the EU Whistleblower Protection 
Directive to gain business value
Selecting the right skills, routines and system for 
internal reporting presents you with an opportunity 
for getting real business value from whistleblowing. 
Many WhistleB customers implement a whistleblowing 
system as a preventive measure. The very fact that the 
system is available may prevent misconduct occurring 
in the first place. Avoiding or minimising damages by 
implementing effective whistleblowing channels can 
prove a great return on investment on its own.

\n\nEU Whistleblower Protection Directive	
1
	 Confidentiality of the identity
of the whistleblower
What the law says:
The procedures for reporting and following-up of 
reports shall include channels for receiving the 
reports which are designed, set up and operated in 
a secure manner that ensures the confidentiality 
of the identity of the reporting person and any third 
party mentioned in the report, and prevents access 
to non-authorised staff members.
Our advice:
Allow anonymous reporting and dialogue.		
Anonymous reporting and dialogue are essential 
for people who have the courage to reach out. 
Use a system that enables you to ensure the 
whistleblower’s anonymity both when reporting 
and in the ensuing dialogue.
Use a system with a secure case management 
tool, through which you can appoint people who 
are authorised to read and act on reports 
received.	
2
	 Response times
What the law says:
The procedures for reporting and following-up of 
reports shall include an acknowledgment of receipt 
to the reporting person within no more than seven 
days. The law also sets a time limit of three months 
from the receipt is set up to provide feedback to 
the reporting person about the follow-up.
Our advice:
	 Make sure that you have a dedicated team to 
receive the reports, and the right team to handle 
and provide feedback to the whistleblower in a 
timely manner.
	The receiver of whistleblower messages should 
be notified immediately by text message 
and e-mail that a report has been received. 
However, limit use of e-mail to notifications, 
all whistleblower messages that can contain 
sensitive or personal data should be securely 
encrypted and managed within a secure system.
	If your organisation receives many messages, 
you might want to have standard responses 
ready to send out to the whistleblower.

	 Contact persons
What the law says:
The procedures for reporting and following-up 
of reports shall include the designation of an 
impartial person or department competent for 
following up on the reports and which will maintain 
communication with and, where necessary, ask for 
further information from and provide feedback to 
the reporting person.
Our advice:
Ensure the right system, skills and processes are in 
place to handle investigations.
	 Set up a team that is as non-operational as 
possible, and with roles from a range of different 
parts of the organisation. This strengthens 
the integrity of the team. In the WhistleB 2019 
customer study, the whistleblowing team most 
often included these competences: legal and 
compliance, internal audit and risk, ethics and 
HR. Having Board representatives on the team is 
also becoming more common.
	 Make sure that you have a system that allows you 
to add the competences you need per case.
	 Make sure that you have a channel through which 
the whistleblower can add pictures, videos, text 
documents and other file formats while also 
allowing metadata cleansing.
	 4 	 Follow-up
What the law says:
The procedures for reporting and following-up of 
reports shall include diligent follow-up to the report 
by the designated person or department, diligent 
follow–up where provided for in national law as 
regards anonymous reporting, and a reasonable 
timeframe to provide feedback to the reporting 
person about the follow-up to the report.
Our advice:
Select a robust case management system to 
underpin diligent follow-up
	 Ensure your whistleblower system includes a 
case management tool that is integrated with the 
reporting channel and allows for dialogue with an 
anonymous or non-anonymous whistleblower. 
This will ensure seamless, compliant and secure 
case follow-up and processing.
	 If your organisation operates multi-nationally, 
select a system with safe and secure translation 
support for communication in any language.
Assess how your organisation handles investigations.
	 Treat investigations with the utmost 
confidentiality and with respect for both the 
whistleblower and the person accused.
	 Establish processes for any action plans needed 
based on the outcome of the investigations.
	 Investigations can require very specialist skills 
which leaders may need to source externally, or 
you might want to have an external team to receive 
your reports. In this case, a system that allows 
external users to be securely included in case 
handling is important.

\n\n	 5 	 Communication & information
What the law says:
The procedures for reporting and following-up of 
reports shall include clear and easily accessible 
information regarding the conditions and 
procedures for reporting externally to competent 
authorities and, where relevant, to institutions, 
bodies, offices or agencies of the Union.
Our advice:
Do all you can to give people confidence to  
report internally.
Having your own trustworthy whistleblowing 
system, knowledgeable people handling the 
messages and a thorough process increase the 
organisation’s chances of receiving messages 
internally, and to be able to address and correct 
matters appropriately. A robust whistleblowing 
system is a concrete way of showing that you 
mean what you say in your ethical guidelines and 
that the organisation is willing to listen when 
things go wrong. It is also a form of insurance; 
with an internal whistleblowing system in place 
you can prevent inappropriate conduct happening 
in the first place.
	 6 	 GDPR Compliance
What the law says:
Any processing of personal data carried out pursuant to 
the directive must comply with the GDPR.
Our advice:
A GDPR compliant system makes things easy for you.
	 Choose a system that is GDPR compliant, built to 
help you to comply with the GDPR.
	 Useful features for compliance include case and 
user logs, safe and secure translations and deletion 
of personal data when the case is closed.
	 Check that you inform potential users correctly 
about national differences in reporting.
	 7 	 Record keeping of the reports
What the law says:
Authorities, private and public legal entities must keep 
records of every report received, in compliance with 
the confidentiality requirements provided for. Reports 
shall be stored for no longer than it is necessary and 
proportionate.
Our advice:
Complete and close cases within one integrated 
whistleblower system.
	 Ensure that you can keep a user and case log of each 
case. A GDPR compliant whistleblowing system does 
this automatically for you.
	 Ensure that your whistleblowing system allows for 
deleting personal data in line with the GDPR principle 
of accountability.
